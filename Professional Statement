As a dedicated professional with a solid foundation in customer service and operational security
from my background in mail delivery, dry cleaning, and retail, I have successfully transitioned my
skills into the cybersecurity domain. I am proud to have completed and obtained the Google
Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and, most recently, the CompTIA Security+ Certification,
demonstrating a robust understanding of cybersecurity principles, threat detection, and
mitigation strategies. I am currently putting this knowledge into practice through hands-on labs
and challenges on TryHackMe, further solidifying my practical skills.


My recent experience as an ISP Support Technician at NRTC has further honed my ability to
troubleshoot complex technical issues, manage sensitive information, and ensure the secure
and smooth flow of operations in a dynamic digital environment. This role has reinforced my
expertise in identifying and mitigating potential security threats while maintaining a
customer-centric approach. I am passionate about safeguarding digital assets and upholding
system integrity, and I am eager to contribute my proven problem-solving abilities and
commitment to excellence to a cybersecurity team or organization.

Thank you for your consideration,

Zachary Carriker
